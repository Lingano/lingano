## Tutorial how to run the app

1. Start backend app: <br/>

```sh
cd api
npm install
npm run start
```

2. Start frontend app: <br/>

```sh
cd ../client
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app should automatically open your default browser on localhost:5173

It might be useful to install react-devtools to debug a bit better than the normal devtools.
